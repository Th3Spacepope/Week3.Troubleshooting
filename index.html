<h1>Troubleshooting 3 | MUST 4707</h1>ss

<h2>Finding Errors in Existing Code and Fixing Them</h2>
<p>In this assignment, you will update the file <code>script.js</code> and commit it to your assignment repository. Your updated version of <code>script.js</code> should run without any errors. The object <code>myWinterCoat</code> should have all of the proper syntax required of an object. If it does, it will export properly and your code will pass all of the tests.</p>

<h3>Troubleshooting</h3>
<p>Troubleshooting is the process of identifying, diagnosing, and resolving issues or problems in a system, device, software, or any complex situation. It involves systematically analyzing the symptoms, investigating potential causes, and implementing solutions to restore normal functionality or achieve the desired outcome. Troubleshooting is a critical skill used in various fields, including technology, engineering, and everyday problem-solving, to address and fix problems efficiently.</p>
